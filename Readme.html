<center><h1>Memory-based Conditional map 16 blocks</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This ASM resource allows you to have more than 128 bit flags in your entire game (up to 2048 flags). It is done by instead of storing the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; or &ldquo;used-up&rdquo; memory data directly into Lunar Magic's Conditional Map16 (CM16) bit flags at
RAM <kbd>$7FC060~$7FC06F</kbd>, it instead writes to freeram (<kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag</kbd>) where it is saved. This freeram can take an arbitrary size (ranging from 16 to 256 bytes of storage). When a level utilizing this resource
loads, it transfers a portion of the freeram, 16 bytes of it, to <kbd>$7FC060~$7FC06F</kbd>, causing blocks using the CM16 flags to appear/disappear, or to change one of the 2 blocks. Note that this still mean you can have up to 128 bit flags
per level.</p>

<p>As a bonus, this ASM resource does not need duplicate blocks on the map16 editor to tell what specific flag they are associated to. Instead, they search through a list of levels, what layer, and what
index of <a href="https://smwc.me/m/smw/ram/7EC800"><kbd>$C800</kbd></a> to determine what flag number they should set (if not found, will output a value of <kbd>$FFFE</kbd> to indicate not found,
which can be used as a failsafe).</p>

<p>The blocks included in this ASM resources is a key (collectible and not carried like a key sprite), locked gates* and doors*.</p>

<ul><li>(*I termed &ldquo;gates&rdquo; and &ldquo;doors&rdquo; as two separate things: &ldquo;gates&rdquo; refer to solid objects that acts as a barrier to prevent the player from accessing other parts of the
level the player is currently in, while &ldquo;doors&rdquo; is an exit-enabled object that teleports the player to another level. This terminology is to prevent confusion since both in real-life terms,
they control access to another point.)</li></ul>

<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=18531">SRAM/BWRAM plus patch</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommended</h2>
<li>Status bar patches (Vanilla SMW's HUD is limited)
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=19247">Super status bar</a>. By default, the defines in this package assumes you are using this patch.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=39887">Address tracker</a>. This ASM resource can take up a considerable amount of RAM.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<h2>Useful stuff provided here</h2>
<ul>
<li>I made a <a href="Readme_files/JS_MemoryCalculator.html" id="MemoryCalculator2">Javascript tool</a> that displays the memory statistics, what flag number is in what byte (or what RAM address its located), and
what flag gets written to what flag in <kbd>$7FC060</kbd>, good for debugging among other things.</li>
<li>For debugging and dealing with bitwise values, I've provided a fast and easy <a href="Readme_files/JS_HexBinary.html" id="HexBinary">simple converter</a> between hex and binary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before we begin...</h2>
<p>This is the type of ASM resource that you may have to come back, edit stuff, and then re-insert periodically as you develop your hack, since this works in tandem of you creating levels. Instructions below marked with
&ldquo;<sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup>&rdquo; indicates you to perform these steps when re-inserting in your hack.</p>

<p>I've included a sample level (for level 105) demonstrating the key blocks, along with sample ASM tables (what flags the blocks should be using and what group-128 to use in level 105).</p>

<p><s>If you are using this on SA-1, LM version 3.10 (September 24, 2019) and before it, they have a bug <a href="https://smwc.me/1522106">I've reported</a> that causes blocks to fail to spawn (or spawn when it shouldn't (never experienced this))
even when <kbd>$7FC060-$7FC06F</kbd> bits are set (or clear) on certain emulators. This is due to the fact that level load code is processed under SA-1, so WRAM (<kbd>$7Exxxx</kbd> and <kbd>$7Fxxxx</kbd>) access
<abbr title="Certain emulators, like ZMZ would allow SA-1 to access WRAM as they &ldquo;read&rdquo; the instructions, which the real SNES (and accurate emulators, like BSNES+) doesn't do. ">will not work</abbr>. So
don't use this ASM resource on an SA-1 hack using LMv3.10 (or any previous LM versions), as blocks may appear (or not) incorrectly can occur on certain emulators.</s><br><br>

EDIT: This is now fixed on version 3.11 (released on 2020/02/09)</p>
<h2>Insertion</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Freerams and tables:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Because the blocks and uberasm tool check their locations and level numbers, you must open these files with a text editor and edit:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<kbd>UberasmTool/Library/MBCM16WriteGroup128To7FC060.asm</kbd>, this determines what what section of RAM defined as <kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag</kbd>, (referred to as &ldquo;group-128&rdquo;) to use for each level using the MBCM16.
						See the stuff under label <kbd>.LevelList</kbd> (make sure you read the comments!).
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>UberasmTool/Level/MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm</kbd>, this calls a subroutine to write to LM's CM16 on level load, and displays the key counter on the heads-up display (HUD) of how many keys of a particular level (uses extra byte to determine
						which key counter to use). This does not support sprite status bar patches.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>CustomBlocks/routines/MBCM16SearchBlockFlagIndex.asm</kbd>, this is a routine that searches for what index matches with the block being touched (times 2 and on accumulator), to determine what flag the block to set/reset so it doesn't respawn on level (re)load. If not found,
						it returns a value of <kbd>$FFFE</kbd> if not found.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>CustomBlocks/routines/MBCM16GetWhatKeyCounter</kbd>, blocks' routine to find what key counter to use (this system supports separate key counters, akin to most <i>Zelda</i> games since <i>A Link to the Past</i> that you cannot use a small key
						from one dungeon in another).
					</li>
				</ul>
				These contains a list of level numbers, block location within level and group numbers (times <kbd>$10</kbd>), and what key counter for the level to use.
				Comments should fully explained how each table correspond. Even better is that the JS tool (linked previously) also print out placeholder template tables (with comments
				pointing of each item and their flag numbers/Level ID) for you to copy.
				
				<li>Open <kbd>MBCM16Defines/Defines.asm</kbd> and change any define that are <kbd>!Freeram_&lt;Name_here&gt;</kbd> setting if you find RAM conflicts with another ASM resource (including itself). I highly
				recommend make note as (including before and after) you insert any patches (including third party) so it is easier to keep track of (I made a <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=39887">javascript tool that tracks this</a>). There's also other settings you
				can play around with. Also, this assumes you are using the super status bar patch, if you are not using that and/or using other patches, adjust the defines under &ldquo;<kbd>HUD stuff</kbd>&rdquo;.</li>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Using SRAM/BWRAM plus patch.
		<ol>
			<li>
				Open either SRAM or BWRAM plus depending on if your hack is SA-1 or not. Using <a href="Readme_files/JS_MemoryCalculator.html" id="JS_MemoryCalculator2_SRAMBwram">this JS tool</a>, copy the given ASM tables from an obviously named
				section of the output and paste them accordingly. Remember that the order in table and defaults must match (the first <kbd>dl $xxxxxx : dw $yyyy</kbd> goes to the first group of bytes
				in &ldquo;<kbd>defaults</kbd>&rdquo;, second on second, and so on). Remember that this is the default value they would be when you start a new game (and if you have saved the game, make sure you start a new file or erase the old saved data).<br><br>
				
				Keep in mind about LM's CM16:
				<ul>
					<li>
						With &ldquo;Always show objects&rdquo; unchecked, if the flag is 0, it uses tile <kbd>$0025</kbd>, otherwise use the tile you've just placed down. If you want
						something to not exist but later in the game to appear forever, then you should default the flag to 0 and SET the bit on an event the player does something to make it appear.
						To make it disappear and stays gone forever, you should default the flag to 1 and CLEAR the flag on an event the player does something to make it gone forever (such as
						when the player picks up the key).
					</li>
					<li>
						With &ldquo;Always show objects&rdquo; checked, if the flag is 0, it uses the tile you've placed down, otherwise it will use <kbd>Tile_Youve_Placed_Down+$0100</kbd> (example:
						if you use tile <kbd>$0425</kbd>, it will use that tile when the flag is 0, otherwise it will use <kbd>$0<u>5</u>25</kbd>, which is the next map16 page keeping its low byte).<br><br>
						
						Seems only useful if you don't want to use tile <kbd>$0025</kbd>. To keep things organized when using both settings (&ldquo;Always show objects&rdquo; checked
						for some blocks and unchecked for others), I would recommend having all the default values in this table be set (<kbd>%11111111</kbd>) and always clear them when the
						player triggers something, and have the intended &ldquo;inital&rdquo; block state on the second of the two map16 pages (<kbd>$0525</kbd> (inital) &rightarrow; <kbd>$0425</kbd> (block you place)).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Thus, you are not restricted to using all eight ones or all eight zeroes in the bytes.</p>
				
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Uberasm tool insertion</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup>In any level that are using the flags, you use <kbd>MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm</kbd> to load the flags into LM's <kbd>$7FC060~$7FC06F</kbd>. UAT's 2.0's list file for levels should be like this (using the provided default example):
<table><tr><td><pre>
105	MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm : $00
1CB	MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm : $00
106	MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm : $01
1CA	MBCM16DisplayKeyCounter.asm : $01
</pre></td></tr></table><br><br>
				The extra byte here specify what key counter index to display. Also must correlate with the list in <kbd>CustomBlocks/Routines/MBCM16GetWhatKeyCounter.asm</kbd><br><br>

				What will happen is when the level loads, <kbd>$7FC060~$7FC06F</kbd> is now written from <kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag+(&lt;Group_Number&gt;*$10)</kbd> to
				<kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag+((&lt;Group_Number&gt;*$10)+$0F)</kbd>. Group number is found in <kbd>.OneHundredTwentyEightFlagGroupList</kbd>
				in <kbd>UberasmTool/Library/MBCM16WriteGroup128To7FC060.asm</kbd>. This also displays the key counter (or write blank tile <kbd>$FC</kbd> if you don't have any)
				on the status bar/HUD.<br><br>
				
				After the level loads, the init and main will write the key counter on the status bar (writes blank tiles instead if having no keys).
			</li>
			<li>
				<sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup>Specify what group-128 in <kbd>MBCM16WriteGroup128To7FC060.asm</kbd> should your level will use,

				<li>
					<sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup> Make sure you edit the tables in <kbd>MBCM16GetWhatKeyCounter.asm</kbd> and <kbd>MBCM16SearchBlockFlagIndex.asm</kbd>

					Then paste these files, they should have obvious names, however, for <kbd>GFX28.bin</kbd> (status bar tiles), you can either replace the original
					with that in the &ldquo;Graphics&rdquo; folder, or rename it <kbd>ExGFXYY</kbd> where <kbd>YY</kbd> is the hexadecimal number of what slot you
					want to insert to (and to use it in a level, it must be on LG1). Now insert the graphics by pressing &ldquo;Quick Insert GFX and ExGFX to ROM, reload graphics&rdquo;

				</li>

		<li>
			Placing blocks in the level
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup><a href="#BlockInsertTables" id="TopLeftGroup">^</a>, Every time you place blocks in the level, you have to assign them to their respective flags, this involves
					the frequent editing of <kbd>MBCM16SearchBlockFlagIndex.asm</kbd>. While finding the level numbers and what layer
					they're on is easy, the block coordinate is displayed LM's status bar on the bottom-left corner of what block your mouse cursor is hovering:<br>
					<img src="Readme_files/LM_BlockCoords.png"><br>
					Note that on and after <kbd>Version 3.03 April 1, 2019</kbd>, the coordinates are displayed in hexadecimal numbers, before this, they were decimal.<br><br>
					Use the X and Y coordinate for the table <kbd>?GetFlagNumberC800IndexStart:</kbd>. If involving multi-blocks,
					such as gates that are more than 1 block wide and/or tall, you would take the top-leftmost block's coordinate of the multi-blocks group (shown in red squares):<br>
					<a href="Readme_files/TopLeftAssignedBlock.png" target="_blank"><img src="Readme_files/TopLeftAssignedBlock.png" width="800"></a></p>
					
					<p>When dealing with doors (exit enabled objects that take you to another level), if you have the define setting <kbd>!TopPart</kbd> set to <kbd>!False</kbd>,
					(a regular-sized 16x32 door setting that allows any powerup instead of just small mario) the block would use the block position <i>above</i> it (the custom block
					itself will act as the lower part of the 16x32 door and the top part is the selected coordinate), unless the lower half of the door is at <kbd>Y=$0000</kbd>,
					(the selected coordinate will use <kbd>Y=$0000</kbd> instead of <kbd>Y=$FFFF</kbd>):</p>
					<img src="Readme_files/DoorSelectedCoordinate.png">

				</li>
				<li>
					<sup><font color="yellow">[Return later]</font></sup>Also every time you place these memorized blocks, is that you must select them (all within the group if
					multi-blocks like the locked gates), then give them their conditional map16 flags by <kbd>Menubar</kbd> &rightarrow;
					<kbd>Edit</kbd> &rightarrow; <kbd>Conditional Direct Map16...</kbd>, otherwise they'll keep reappearing every level
					load.<br><br>
					
					What LMCM16 flag number you should put down is the flag number of <kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag</kbd>, MOD 128. For example:<br>
					<table>
					<tr><th>Flag number of <kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag</kbd></th><th>LM's flag number</th></tr>
					<tr><td>$000 (Group 0)</td><td>$00</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$001 (Group 0)</td><td>$01</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$002 (Group 0)</td><td>$02</td></tr>
					<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$07E (Group 0)</td><td>$7E</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$07F (Group 0)</td><td>$7F</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$080 (Group 1)</td><td>$00</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$081 (Group 1)</td><td>$01</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$082 (Group 1)</td><td>$02</td></tr>
					<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$0FE (Group 1)</td><td>$7E</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$0FF (Group 1)</td><td>$7F</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$100 (Group 2)</td><td>$00</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$101 (Group 2)</td><td>$01</td></tr>
					<tr><td>$102 (Group 2)</td><td>$02</td></tr>
					<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
					</table><br>
					Also remember that up to 128 different flag numbers can be used per level, this means, for example if you end up with one level
					using 128 flag numbers (<kbd>$00-$7F</kbd>), you'll need to use another level to use additional flags.<br><br>
					
					When the level loads, what group-128 to use to write to <kbd>$7FC060</kbd> is specified in <kbd>UberasmTool/Library/MBCM16WriteGroup128To7FC060.asm</kbd>.
					With the previously mentioned paragraph, when you choose any group-128, you are bounded to a range of what flag numbers of <kbd>!Freeram_MBCM16_MemoryFlag</kbd> to use:<br>
					[<kbd>LowestFlagNumber = GroupNumber * 128</kbd>] to [<kbd>HighestFlagNumber = (GroupNumber * 128) + 127</kbd>]<br>
					For example, if level <kbd>$105</kbd> uses group <kbd>$0</kbd>, only flags <kbd>$0-$7F</kbd> are available in that level, if level <kbd>$1CB</kbd> uses group <kbd>$1</kbd>,
					only flags <kbd>$80-$FF</kbd> are available.

	</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Notes and Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		If you're unsure if you had set up the flag and level tables correctly I have some protips:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use the block <kbd>Template_PermaDisappear.asm</kbd>, place it in the level, and touch it. If it doesn't disappear in a puff of smoke, then
				that block location isn't assigned to a flag number. You can use other blocks, they will simply do nothing if it doesn't find its location associated to a flag number.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the block do function but keeps respawning on level load, then that means there is something wrong with the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<kbd>MBCM16WriteGroup128To7FC060.asm</kbd> (uberasm tool library) isn't set up correctly, set to use the wrong level number, wrong group-128, wrong layer, and/or wrong block C800 positions.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must've set the block to the wrong flag number that is assigned.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Otherwise if another block in the same level disappears, then you've set the block to the same flag number. This is correct for multi-block gates bigger than a 1x1 block
				so that the whole door remains gone when unlocked and level refreshes, however if 2+ separate things in the same level uses the same $7FC060 flag number, then both are affected,
				which any of them have been set to the wrong flag.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		You may be asking the question, why does the game lag if the player tries to activate these blocks when they aren't assigned to the list? This is because each frame and each of the player's collision point
		touches the block, it has to search a long list of flag numbers (and fail to find the matching entry), which tanks the game's performance (a loop with huge number of iterations). The longer the list, the
		harder the game will slow down. However, if your entire hack does not contain any non-listed MBCM16 blocks (which your hack <u>should</u> have all of them be listed), you shouldn't worry, since the blocks
		execute for only once for one frame for a listed MBCM16 block the moment the block disappears.
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Just like most loops in vanilla SMW, it checks the last item, going backwards on the index towards the first, this also includes the uberasm tool dealing what group-128 the current level should use.
				Thus if the block you interact is at the lower indexes (close to index/flag 0), it would take longer than the higher indexes to find the matching item.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		When the player enters an exit-enabled locked door (or, in general, teleport to another level), the key counter on the HUD (heads-up display) will not update until the level the player is heading to is loaded. This is because during
		level transition, the HUD no longer update the tiles every frame.
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't have to have all flags to be permanently cleared/set, if you want some levels to only reset them when the player goes to the overworld map via dying, START+SELECT, and beating the level. Just have an ASM file created into uberasm
		tool's gamemode folder to be called on the <kbd>list.txt</kbd> as gamemode <kbd>0D</kbd> (overworld fade-in) or <kbd>0E</kbd> (overworld). I would prefer having this under <kbd>init:</kbd> because it is not necessary to &ldquo;reset&rdquo;
		them every frame on the map (reset in quotes, because, as in to restore their original values, not always have them all zero on all flags):
<table><tr><td><pre>
	init:
	;This will put the flags back to their set position by writing all $FFs:
	LDX.b #&lt;NumberOfBytes&gt;-1
	-
	LDA #$FF			;&gt;Value to write on each byte. $00 = %00000000, $FF = %11111111.
	STA &lt;StartingRAMAddress&gt;
	TXA
	SEC
	SBC #$01
	TAX
	BCS -				;&gt;Why am I not using DEX : BPL -? Because then you're limited to indexes $00-$7F.
</pre></td></tr></table><br>

If you happen to have a byte that contains flags that shouldn't be reverted while other to be reverted:
<table><tr><td><pre>
	;Example: %RRRR----, where R means a bit must be reverted, while - retains its value.
	
	;Clear bits
	LDA $xxxxxx
	AND.b #%00001111		;&gt;AND returns 0s for any matching bit pairs have at least one 0 on either, so AND is used to clear bits.
	STA $xxxxxx			;&gt;$xxxxxx is now %0000xxxx.
	
	;Set bits
	LDA $xxxxxx
	AND.b #%11110000		;&gt;ORA returns 0s if both matching bit pairs are 0, therefore, ORA is used to set bits.
	STA $xxxxxx			;&gt;$xxxxxx is now %1111xxxx.
</pre></td></tr></table><br>
And don't forget, if you are resetting the locked gates and locked doors, you MUST also reset the key counters too, otherwise the locked gates and doors will respawn and the key counter is retained with them also respawning in the level:
<table><tr><td><pre>	LDA #$00
	STA !Freeram_MBCM16_KeyCounter
	STA !Freeram_MBCM16_KeyCounter+1
	;[...]</pre></td></tr></table>
	</li>
</ul>
