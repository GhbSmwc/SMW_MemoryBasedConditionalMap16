 - General HTML files changes:
 -- Now use a more user friendly margin format rather than being on the left
    edge of the viewport and extending full-viewport-width when viewed on a browser.
 -- Code block text can now be easily copied via CTRL+DoubleClick.
 -- Readme.html changes:
 --- Did some rewording and making it easier to understand
 -- JS_MemoryCalculator.html changes:
 --- No longer using the old and not-recommended innerHTML in the javascript code
 --- Uses div tags with "overflow: auto" so that long tables don't cause the whole page to
     extend (annoying to scroll long distance between ASM text).
 --- Added an option (and opted for by default) that lets you enter the flag number
     directly without having to view the entire table.
